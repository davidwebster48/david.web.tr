            <h2>Web App Security</h2>
            <p>My interest in web app security developed after working on security enhancements to AMP Capital&rsquo;s secure client website in 2010. I developed my knowledge in this area at MYOB where I could see the crucial importance of protecting our customers&rsquo; business data. I&rsquo;ve attended a number of OWASP events and a SANS course about Web App Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking.</p>
            <p>I have been involved in the PCI-DSS compliance process for EatNow.com.au, BupaOptical.com.au and MYOB.</p>

            <h2>Data Science</h2>
            <p>I am fascinated by data analysis, machine learning, predictive modelling and artificial intelligence. I don&rsquo;t have much expertise in this area, but would jump at any opportunity to be involved in it and learn more.</p>
            <p>Recently at Menulog I worked on a small lead scoring project using XGBoost.</p>

            <h2>Performance tuning</h2>
			<p>I enjoy improving the efficiency of software. This can make the user interface more responsive, and improve user satisfaction. It can also enable a system to serve a higher volume of traffic, or reduce the running costs of the system&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
			<p>At Infosys I spent a lot of time tuning the Oracle SQL queries used for generating reports for Telstra&rsquo;s Enterprise Program Management system.</p>
			<p>At MYOB I did a major refactoring of the application to eliminate a performance bottleneck related to matching bank transactions with journal entries. This allowed us to remove a large number a stored procedures from the database and replace them with much simpler and more efficient code.</p>
			<p>At Menulog Group I made use of AWS&rsquo;s ElastiCache for Memcache to ensure that EatNow could scale to over 200 orders per minute.</p>
