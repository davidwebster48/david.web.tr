            <h2>Web App Security</h2>
            <p>My interest in web app security developed after working on security enhancements to AMP Capital's secure client website in 2010. I developed my knowledge in this area at MYOB where I could see the crucial importance of protecting our customers' business data. I've attended a number of OWASP events and a SANS course about Web App Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking.</p>
            <p>I have been involved in the PCI-DSS compliance process for EatNow.com.au, BupaOptical.com.au and MYOB.</p>

            <h2>Data Science</h2>
            <p>I am fascinated by data analysis, machine learning, predictive modelling and artificial intelligence. I don't have much expertise in this area, but would jump at any opportunity to be involved in it and learn more.</p>
            <p>Recently at Menulog I worked on a small lead scoring project using XGBoost.</p>

            <h2>Performance tuning</h2>
            <p>I enjoy improving the efficiency of software. This can make the user interface more responsive, and reduce users' frustration. It can also enable a system to serve a higher volume of traffic, or reduce the running costs of the system's infrastructure.</p>
            <p>I have experience tuning web based systems, batch processes and reporting jobs.</p>
