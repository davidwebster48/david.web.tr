            <h2>Childhood</h2>
			<p>I was born in Melbourne&rsquo;s south east, and am the eldest of three children. I attended a government primary school and catholic secondary school. My father was a civil engineer and my mother was a full time parent.</p>
			<p>I went on holidays with my family to Sydney, Queensland, central Australia and many places in Victoria.</p>
			<p>I joined Cub Scouts when I was about 8 and continued through all the sections of Scouts up to Rovers (in my early 20s). I enjoyed camping and hiking trips on the Mornington Peninsula, Wilson&rsquo;s Prom and Victoria&rsquo;s high country, as well as the 1998 Jamboree in Queensland.</p>

            <h2>Travels</h2>
			<p>In my 20s I was lucky to have opportunities to travel overseas.</p>
			<p>I visited New Zealand in 2003 and took a fantastic Contiki tour of both islands with a friend from uni.</p>
			<p>In 2004 I went on an amazing Intrepid tour of China, and also visited Singapore.</p>
			<p>In 2005 I was working for Infosys, and I went to their 2 month graduate training course in Mysore (India). After the training I toured South India, North India and Malaysia.</p>
			<p>In 2006 I visited India again, to attend the wedding in Punjab of friend and colleague I met on my first visit.</p>
			<p>In 2008 I went to Thailand with my (then) girlfriend (now wife!). We had a great time visiting Bangkok, Kanchanaburi, Chiang Mai, Phuket and Ko Samui.</p>
			<p>In 2009 my wife and I spent a week in Vanuatu for our honeymoon.</p>
