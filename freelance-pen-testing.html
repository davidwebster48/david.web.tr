		  <p>My passion is web application security. I love looking at how websites work, looking for weaknesses <em>and fixing them</em>.</p>
		  <p>During my ten years of commercial IT experience, I have developed a deep understanding of how the web works. I have worked on websites for small start-ups to multi-billion dollar investment companies and had the opportunity to learn from some of Australia's leading IT security experts.</p>
		  <p>I will look for the weaknesses on your site that a hacker could use to deface your site, steal your customer data or send spam from your mail server.</p>
		  <p>I will use a combination of automated tools and manual techniques to find vulnerabilities in your website, and I will take the time to explain them to you in plain English, discuss with you to decide which vulnerabilities should be fixed, and I can fix them.</p>
		  <p>I have experience with a wide range of technologies and frameworks, including PHP, Spring, JSP, ASP, .NET, Perl, WordPress and others.</p>
		  <p>I am a regular contributor on <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/users/21558/davidwebster48">security.stackexchange.com</a>.</p>
		  <p>I am a member of the <a href="https://www.owasp.orgâ€Ž">Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)</a>.</p>
		  <p>I am <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/davidwebster48">a tester on Bugcrowd</a>.</p>
		  <p>In 2013 I completed the <a href="http://www.sans.org/course/web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking">Web App Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking course</a> delivered by SANS.</p>
		  <p>Please <a href="mailto:david@whirlweb.com.au">contact me</a> and we can discuss your needs. I am based in Melbourne's South East suburbs.</p>
