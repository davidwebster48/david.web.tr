			<p>I enjoy being productive and delivering value to the organisation I&rsquo;m working for. I&rsquo;m happy to take a leadership role (as I have in Menulog Group), but don&rsquo;t see that as essential to my fulfillment.</p>
			<p>At the moment I am most productive when using Java, but I&rsquo;d be happy to learn other languages and frameworks, especially Kotlin. I am very familiar with jQuery, and plan to learn Vue.js, and would also be happy to learn other modern Javascript frameworks like React.</p>
			<p>At MYOB and Menulog Group I have worked for a considerable time in the same business and it has allowed me to gain a deep knowledge of the business and technology, which in turn, has allowed me to be highly productive, which I find satisfying. I hope I can repeat this in future jobs.</p>
			<p>I don&rsquo;t want to just spend my whole time working on code, I&rsquo;d enjoy a job where I can also contribute in other ways, for example analysing data, defining requirements, researching new ideas and approaches, devops, leadership and managing vendors.</p>
			<p>I want to stay in Melbourne (not relocate) so I can be close to my extended family.</p>
