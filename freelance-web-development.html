		  <p>When you look at my freelance work, please remember that it was done within my clients&rsquo; budgets, according to my clients&rsquo; requirements, and sometimes fitting in with their existing web sites.</p>
		
		  <div class="project">
		    <h2><a href="http://www.eternalingredients.com.au">Eternal Ingredients &ndash; Cookbooks created for you, by you</a></h2>
		    <p>I created the part of the website where users can create cookbooks, invite others to contribute to their books, manager their recipe libraries and order copies of the books.</p>
		    <p>I also did some customisations and configuration to the WordPress marketing side of the website.</p>
	    </div>
		
		  <div class="project">
		    <h2><a href="https://www.meyou.com.au">meYOU - The Free Online Billboard for University Students and Staff</a></h2>
		    <p>I worked with graphic designer Robyn Kyberd to launch this site for my client, Ryan. Since then I have done a large number of customisations to this Joomla based site, to add features and adjust how things work. You can read the <a href="http://www-public.jcu.edu.au/atjcu/feature/JCU_101153">story behind meYOU, from the site&rsquo;s owner</a>.</p>

		  <div class="project">
		    <h2><a href="http://www.testize.com">Testize - Cross Browser Testing</a></h2>
		    <p>I wrote the front-end code for side by side image comparison, with synchronised scrolling and zooming. I also wrote the front-end code for selecting parts of the image and adding notes.</p>
		  </div>

		  <div class="project">
		    <h2><a href="http://www.indiemunity.com">indiemunity - A platform for marketing and discovering great music, equipped with a fully functional music store</a></h2>
		    <p>I built this site from scratch, to look similar to a previous version. I made use of the <a href="http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/">jQuery Address plugin</a> to create a one-page app so that the music player would not be interrupted on navigation, and the pages are bookmarkable and the browser&rsquo;s back and forward buttons work.</p>
		    <p>The site integrates with PayPal Adaptive Payments so that when a customer makes a purchase the funds go directly to the artist.</p>
		  </div>

		  <div class="project">
		    <h2><a href="http://www.fedant.org/">FEDANT</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.grcct.org/">GRCCT</a></h2>
		    <p>These sites allow visitors to search lists of registered providers of health services. 
		    The owner of this site was concerned about the lists of providers getting harvested by screen-scrapers. 
		    I added a number of anti-screen scraper features, including captcha, displaying sensitive details as images instead of text and rate-limiting.</p>
